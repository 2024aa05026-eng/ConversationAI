    "text": "In deep learning , the transformer is an artificial neural network architecture based on the multi-head attention mechanism , in which text is converted to numerical representations called tokens , and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table . At each layer , each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other ( unmasked ) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism , allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished . Transformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units , therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures ( RNNs ) such as long short-term memory ( LSTM ) . Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models ( LLMs ) on large ( language ) datasets . The modern version of the transformer was proposed in the 2017 paper `` Attention Is All You Need '' by researchers at Google . The predecessors of transformers were developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation , but have found many applications since . They are used in large-scale natural language processing , computer vision ( vision transformers ) , reinforcement learning , audio , multimodal learning , robotics , and even playing chess . It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems , such as generative pre-trained transformers ( GPTs ) and BERT ( bidirectional encoder representations from transformers ) .

In theory , the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence , but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model 's state at the end of a long sentence without precise , extractable information about preceding tokens . A key breakthrough was LSTM ( 1995 ) , [ note 1 ] an RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem , allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling . One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons , so-called multiplicative units . Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks or higher-order networks . LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of transformers . However , LSTM still used sequential processing , like most other RNNs . [ note 2 ] Specifically , RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last ; they can not operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence . Modern transformers overcome this problem , but unlike RNNs , they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window . The linearly scaling fast weight controller ( 1992 ) learns to compute a weight matrix for further processing depending on the input . One of its two networks has `` fast weights '' or `` dynamic links '' ( 1981 ) .

A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries . This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear transformer . The idea of encoder\u2013decoder sequence transduction had been developed in the early 2010s ; commonly cited as the originators that produced seq2seq are two concurrently published papers from 2014 . A 380M-parameter model for machine translation uses two long short-term memories ( LSTM ) . Its architecture consists of two parts . The encoder is an LSTM that takes in a sequence of tokens and turns it into a vector . The decoder is another LSTM that converts the vector into a sequence of tokens . Similarly , another 130M-parameter model used gated recurrent units ( GRU ) instead of LSTM . Later research showed that GRUs are neither better nor worse than LSTMs for seq2seq . These early seq2seq models had no attention mechanism , and the state vector is accessible only after the last word of the source text was processed . Although in theory such a vector retains the information about the whole original sentence , in practice the information is poorly preserved . This is because the input is processed sequentially by one recurrent network into a fixed-size output vector , which is then processed by another recurrent network into an output . If the input is long , then the output vector would not be able to contain all relevant information , degrading the output . As evidence , reversing the input sentence improved seq2seq translation ."

If the input is long , then the output vector would not be able to contain all relevant information , degrading the output . As evidence , reversing the input sentence improved seq2seq translation . The RNN search model introduced an attention mechanism to seq2seq for machine translation to solve the bottleneck problem ( of the fixed-size output vector ) , allowing the model to process long-distance dependencies more easily . The name is because it `` emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation '' . The relative performances were compared between global ( that of RNN search ) and local ( sliding window ) attention model architectures for machine translation , finding that mixed attention had higher quality than global attention , while local attention reduced translation time . In 2016 , Google Translate was revamped to Google Neural Machine Translation , which replaced the previous model based on statistical machine translation . The new model was a seq2seq model where the encoder and the decoder were both 8 layers of bidirectional LSTM . It took nine months to develop , and it outperformed the statistical approach , which took ten years to develop . Seq2seq models with attention ( including self-attention ) still suffered from the same issue with recurrent networks , which is that they are hard to parallelize , which prevented them from being accelerated on GPUs . In 2016 , decomposable attention applied a self-attention mechanism to feedforward networks , which are easy to parallelize , and achieved SOTA result in textual entailment with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than LSTMs .

One of its authors , Jakob Uszkoreit , suspected that attention without recurrence would be sufficient for language translation , thus the title `` attention is all you need '' . That hypothesis was against conventional wisdom at the time , and even his father Hans Uszkoreit , a well-known computational linguist , was skeptical . In the same year , self-attention ( called intra-attention or intra-sentence attention ) was proposed for LSTMs . In 2017 , the original ( 100M-sized ) encoder\u2013decoder transformer model was proposed in the `` Attention is all you need '' paper . At the time , the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation , by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel , but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance . This led to the introduction of a multi-head attention model that was easier to parallelize due to the use of independent heads and the lack of recurrence . Its parallelizability was an important factor to its widespread use in large neural networks . As early as spring 2017 , even before the `` Attention is all you need '' preprint was published , one of the co-authors applied the `` decoder-only '' variation of the architecture to generate fictitious Wikipedia articles .

It was followed by BERT ( 2018 ) , an encoder-only transformer model . In 2019 October , Google started using BERT to process search queries . In 2020 , Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model . Starting in 2018 , the OpenAI GPT series of decoder-only transformers became state of the art in natural language generation . In 2022 , a chatbot based on GPT-3 , ChatGPT , became unexpectedly popular , triggering a boom around large language models . Since 2020 , transformers have been applied in modalities beyond text , including the vision transformer , speech recognition , robotics , and multimodal . The vision transformer , in turn , stimulated new developments in convolutional neural networks . Image and video generators like DALL-E ( 2021 ) , Stable Diffusion 3 ( 2024 ) , and Sora ( 2024 ) , use transformers to analyse input data ( like text prompts ) by breaking it down into `` tokens '' and then calculating the relevance between each token using self-attention , which helps the model understand the context and relationships within the data .

That is , the learning rate should linearly scale up from 0 to maximal value for the first part of the training ( usually recommended to be 2 % of the total number of training steps ) , before decaying again . A 2020 paper found that using layer normalization before ( instead of after ) multihead attention and feedforward layers stabilizes training , not requiring learning rate warmup . Transformers typically are first pretrained by self-supervised learning on a large generic dataset , followed by supervised fine-tuning on a small task-specific dataset . The pretrain dataset is typically an unlabeled large corpus , such as The Pile . Tasks for pretraining and fine-tuning commonly include : The T5 transformer report documents a large number of natural language pretraining tasks . Some examples are : Note that while each of these tasks is trivial or obvious for human native speakers of the language ( or languages ) , they have typically proved challenging for previous generations of machine learning architecture . In general , there are 3 classes of language modelling tasks : `` masked '' , `` autoregressive '' , and `` prefixLM '' . These classes are independent of a specific modeling architecture such as transformer , but they are often discussed in the context of transformer . In a masked task , one or more of the tokens is masked out , and the model would produce a probability distribution predicting what the masked-out tokens are based on the context .

All transformers have the same primary components : The following description follows exactly the transformer as described in the original paper . There are variants , described in the following section . By convention , we write all vectors as row vectors . For example , pushing a vector through a linear layer means multiplying it by a weight matrix on the right , as x W { \\displaystyle xW } . As the transformer architecture natively consists of operations over numbers ( matrix multiplications , dot products , activation functions ) rather than over text , there must first be a mapping from any input text to some numerical representation . This happens in three steps . First , the input text is treated by a preprocessor , which performs both textual transformations and splits the text into coarse-grained segments called pretokens . The latter is referred to as pretokenization . Second , each pretoken is segmented further into tokens by a tokenizer that expects to only see pretokens output by its preprocessor . Each token it produces is a string of one or more characters belonging to a finite set of strings called the vocabulary V { \\displaystyle V } .

Since this mapping is bijective , the output side can produce a sequence of integer identifiers which can then be turned back into tokens . After undoing some of the preprocessing , the result is again legible text . Training a tokenizer ( sometimes referred to as vocabularization ) means finding a suitable vocabulary V { \\displaystyle V } , but also learning how to use it , since any given string s { \\displaystyle s } of length | s | { \\displaystyle |s| } has 2 | s | \u2212 1 { \\displaystyle 2^ { |s|-1 } } hypothetical segmentations , some of which containing segments that are not in the vocabulary . The most important hyperparameter during vocabularization is the vocabulary size | V | { \\displaystyle |V| } : when it is small , the learned vocabulary generally consists of characters and smaller strings , and words will be segmented into many tokens . At larger sizes , it becomes affordable to dedicate tokens to full words , although depending on the preprocessor and tokenizer , it is not necessarily the case that large vocabularies will always use the largest token ( s ) available to segment a word .

In tokenizers that produce tokens that are not part of the vocabulary , a special token that does belong to the vocabulary is used as a generic stand-in , written as `` [ UNK ] '' for `` unknown '' . In principle , any string could be hidden by such an [ UNK ] . Indeed , in information retrieval , pretokenizers were themselves used as tokenizers ( and also called `` tokenizers '' ) with a word-level vocabulary that contained an [ UNK ] . Commonly used subword tokenization algorithms are byte pair encoding ( BPE ) and the unigram language model ( ULM ) , which each include a vocabularization algorithm and a dedicated segmentation algorithm . There also exist several segmentation algorithms that require no learning and can be applied given a vocabulary ( produced by BPE or ULM , for example ) , like greedily recognising tokens in a pretoken by moving through it left-to-right . Well-known software implementations of subword tokenizers are Hugging Face 's tokenizers Python package implemented in Rust , and the sentencepiece Python package implemented in C++ .

This allows the transformer to take any encoded position and find a linear sum of the encoded locations of its neighbors . This sum of encoded positions , when fed into the attention mechanism , would create attention weights on its neighbors , much like what happens in a convolutional neural network language model . In the author 's words , `` we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative position . '' In typical implementations , all operations are done over the real numbers , not the complex numbers , but since complex multiplication can be implemented as real 2-by-2 matrix multiplication , this is a mere notational difference . Like earlier seq2seq models , the original transformer model used an encoder\u2013decoder architecture . The encoder consists of encoding layers that process all the input tokens together one layer after another , while the decoder consists of decoding layers that iteratively process the encoder 's output and the decoder 's output tokens so far . The purpose of each encoder layer is to create contextualized representations of the tokens , where each representation corresponds to a token that `` mixes '' information from other input tokens via self-attention mechanism .

Each decoder layer contains 3 sublayers : the causally masked self-attention , the cross-attention , and the feedforward network . The final points of detail are the residual connections and layer normalization , ( denoted as `` LayerNorm '' , or `` LN '' in the following ) , which while conceptually unnecessary , are necessary for numerical stability and convergence . The residual connection , which is introduced to avoid vanishing gradient issues and stabilize the training process , can be expressed as follows : y = F ( x ) + x . The expression indicates that an output y is the sum of the transformation of input x ( F ( x ) ) and the input itself ( x ) . Adding the input x can preserve the input information and avoid issues when the gradient of F ( x ) is close to zero . Similarly to how the feedforward network modules are applied individually to each vector , the LayerNorm is also applied individually to each vector .

They are also referred to as `` all-to-all '' or `` BERT-like '' . A `` decoder-only '' transformer is not literally decoder-only , since without an encoder , the cross-attention mechanism has nothing to attend to . Thus , the decoder layers in a decoder-only transformer is composed of just two sublayers : the causally masked self-attention , and the feedforward network . This is usually used for text generation and instruction following . The models in the GPT series and Chinchilla series are decoder-only . They are also referred to as `` autoregressive '' or `` causal '' . An `` encoder\u2013decoder '' transformer is generally the same as the original transformer , with 2 sublayers per encoder layer and 3 sublayers per decoder layer , etc . They might have minor architectural improvements , such as alternative activation functions , changing the location of normalization , etc . This is also usually used for text generation and instruction following . The models in the T5 series are encoder\u2013decoder . A `` prefixLM '' ( prefix language model ) is a decoder-only architecture , but with prefix masking , which is different from causal masking . Specifically , it has mask of the form : Figure 3 M prefixLM = [ 0 \u2212 \u221e 0 M causal ] { \\displaystyle M_ { \\text { prefixLM } } = { \\begin { bmatrix } \\mathbf { 0 } & -\\infty \\\\\\mathbf { 0 } & M_ { \\text { causal } } \\end"

They resemble encoder\u2013decoder models , but has less `` sparsity '' . Such models are rarely used , though they are cited as theoretical possibilities and benchmarked comparisons . There are also mixed seq2seq models . For example , in 2020 , Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model with a transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model , as transformer-based decoders did not appear to significantly increase quality unlike the encoder , while the RNN decoder was much faster . The original transformer uses ReLU activation function . Other activation functions were developed . The Llama series and PaLM used SwiGLU ; both GPT-1 and BERT used GELU . Alternative activation functions are often used in combination with Gated Linear Units in the feedforward module . The normalization used in the transformer can be different from LayerNorm . One example is RMSNorm which is used in the Llama series . Other examples include CapsuleNorm ScaleNorm , or FixNorm . Transformers may use other positional encoding methods than sinusoidal .

This is contrasted with the original sinusoidal positional encoding , which is an `` absolute positional encoding '' . The transformer model has been implemented in standard deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch . Transformers is a library produced by Hugging Face that supplies transformer-based architectures and pretrained models . When an autoregressive transformer is used for inference , such as generating text , the query vector is different at each step , but the already-computed key and value vectors are always the same . The KV caching method saves the computed key and value vectors at each attention block , so that they are not recomputed at each new token . PagedAttention applies memory paging to KV caching . If a transformer is used with a baked-in prompt , such as [ `` You are a customer support agent ... '' ] , then the key and value vectors can be computed for the prompt , and saved on disk . The saving in compute is significant when the model is used for many short real-time interactions , such as in online chatbots . FlashAttention is an algorithm that implements the transformer attention mechanism efficiently on a GPU .

It is a communication-avoiding algorithm that performs matrix multiplications in blocks , such that each block fits within the cache of a GPU , and by careful management of the blocks it minimizes data copying between GPU caches ( as data movement is slow ) . See the page on softmax for details . An improved version , FlashAttention-2 , was developed to cater to the rising demand for language models capable of handling longer context lengths . It offers enhancements in work partitioning and parallelism , enabling it to achieve up to 230 TFLOPs/s on A100 GPUs ( FP16/BF16 ) , a 2x speed increase over the original FlashAttention . Key advancements in FlashAttention-2 include the reduction of non-matmul FLOPs , improved parallelism over the sequence length dimension , better work partitioning between GPU warps , and added support for head dimensions up to 256 and multi-query attention ( MQA ) and grouped-query attention ( GQA ) . Benchmarks revealed FlashAttention-2 to be up to 2x faster than FlashAttention and up to 9x faster than a standard attention implementation in PyTorch . Future developments include optimization for new hardware like H100 GPUs and new data types like FP8 . FlashAttention-4 focuses on pipelining to increase instruction throughput , and was developed to perform particularly well on Blackwell GPUs .

MQA is GQA with one group , while standard Multihead Attention is GQA with the maximal number of groups . Multihead Latent Attention ( MLA ) is a low-rank approximation to standard MHA . Specifically , each hidden vector , before entering the attention mechanism , is first projected to two low-dimensional spaces ( `` latent space '' ) , one for query and one for key-value ( KV vector ) . This design minimizes the KV cache , as only the low-dimensional KV vector needs to be cached . Speculative decoding is a method to accelerate token decoding . Similarly to speculative execution in CPUs , future tokens are computed quickly , then verified . If the quickly computed tokens are incorrect , they are discarded and computed slowly . The key factor in speculative decoding is that a transformer decoder can verify faster than it can decode , in the following sense . Suppose we have two transformer models like GPT-3 and GPT-3-small , both with a context window size of 512 . To generate an entire context window autoregressively with greedy decoding with GPT-3 , it must be run for 512 times , each time generating a token x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x 512 { \\displaystyle x_ { 1 } , x_ { 2 } , ... , x_ { 512 } } , taking time 512 T GPT-3 { \\displaystyle 512T_ { \\text { GPT-3 } } } .

In speculative decoding , a smaller model or some other simple heuristic is used to generate a few speculative tokens that are subsequently verified by the larger model .

For non-greedy decoding , similar ideas apply , except the speculative tokens are accepted or rejected stochastically , in a way that guarantees the final output distribution is the same as if speculative decoding was not used . In Multi-Token Prediction , a single forward pass creates a final embedding vector , which then is un-embedded into a token probability . However , that vector can then be further processed by another transformer block to predict the next token , and so on for arbitrarily many steps into the future . This trades off accuracy for speed , since each new token costs just one more transformer block , rather than the entire stack .

The term photosynthesis usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis , a process that releases oxygen as a byproduct of water splitting . Photosynthetic organisms store the converted chemical energy within the bonds of intracellular organic compounds ( complex compounds containing carbon ) , typically carbohydrates like sugars ( mainly glucose , fructose and sucrose ) , starches , phytoglycogen and cellulose . When needing to use this stored energy , an organism 's cells then metabolize the organic compounds through cellular respiration . Photosynthesis plays a critical role in producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth 's atmosphere , and it supplies most of the biological energy necessary for complex life on Earth . Some organisms also perform anoxygenic photosynthesis , which does not produce oxygen . Some bacteria ( e.g . purple bacteria ) use bacteriochlorophyll to split hydrogen sulfide as a reductant instead of water , releasing sulfur instead of oxygen , which was a dominant form of photosynthesis in the euxinic Canfield oceans during the Boring Billion . Archaea such as Halobacterium also perform a type of non-carbon-fixing anoxygenic photosynthesis , where the simpler photopigment retinal and its microbial rhodopsin derivatives are used to absorb green light and produce a proton ( hydron ) gradient across the cell membrane , and the subsequent ion movement powers transmembrane proton pumps to directly synthesize adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , the `` energy currency '' of cells .

Such archaeal photosynthesis might have been the earliest form of photosynthesis that evolved on Earth , as far back as the Paleoarchean , preceding that of cyanobacteria ( see Purple Earth hypothesis ) . While the details may differ between species , the process always begins when light energy is absorbed by the reaction centers , proteins that contain photosynthetic pigments or chromophores . In plants , these pigments are chlorophylls ( a porphyrin derivative that absorbs the red and blue spectra of light , thus reflecting green ) held inside chloroplasts , abundant in leaf cells . In cyanobacteria , they are embedded in the plasma membrane . In these light-dependent reactions , some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances , such as water , producing oxygen gas . The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two important molecules that participate in energetic processes : reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) and ATP . In plants , algae , and cyanobacteria , sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle .

In other bacteria , different mechanisms like the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end . The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life using reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide , rather than water , as sources of electrons . Cyanobacteria appeared later ; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the Earth , which rendered the evolution of complex life possible . The average rate of energy captured by global photosynthesis is approximately 130 terawatts , which is about eight times the total power consumption of human civilization . Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100\u2013115 billion tons ( 91\u2013104 Pg petagrams , or billions of metric tons ) , of carbon into biomass per year . Photosynthesis was discovered in 1779 by Jan Ingenhousz who showed that plants need light , not just soil and water . Most photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs , which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light . However , not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis ; photoheterotrophs use organic compounds , rather than carbon dioxide , as a source of carbon . In plants , algae , and cyanobacteria , photosynthesis releases oxygen . This oxygenic photosynthesis is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms .

Some shade-loving plants ( sciophytes ) produce such low levels of oxygen during photosynthesis that they use all of it themselves instead of releasing it to the atmosphere . Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants , algae , and cyanobacteria , the overall process is quite similar in these organisms . There are also many varieties of anoxygenic photosynthesis , used mostly by bacteria , which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen or which produce elemental sulfur instead of molecular oxygen . Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation ; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates . Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction . In general outline , photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration : while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates , cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrates or other nutrients to carbon dioxide . Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates , amino acids and fatty acids . These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water , and to release chemical energy to drive the organism 's metabolism . Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes , as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments ( cellular respiration in mitochondria ) . The general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by Cornelis van Niel is : Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis , the equation for this process is : This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the light-dependent reaction and a product of the light-independent reaction , but"

In the first stage , light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the hydrogen carrier NADPH and the energy-storage molecule ATP . During the second stage , the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide . Most organisms that use oxygenic photosynthesis use visible light for the light-dependent reactions , although at least three use shortwave infrared or , more specifically , far-red radiation . Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis . Some archaea use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals . The bacteriorhodopsin changes its configuration in response to sunlight , acting as a proton pump . This produces a proton gradient more directly , which is then converted to chemical energy . The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen , and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis .

In photosynthetic bacteria , the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in cell membranes . In its simplest form , this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself . However , the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called thylakoids , or bunched up into round vesicles called intracytoplasmic membranes . These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell , giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb . In plants and algae , photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts . A typical plant cell contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts . The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane . This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane , a phospholipid outer membrane , and an intermembrane space . Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma . Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids ( grana ) , which are the site of photosynthesis . The thylakoids appear as flattened disks . The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane , and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space . Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and peripheral membrane protein complexes of the photosynthetic system . Plants absorb light primarily using the pigment chlorophyll . The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected , which is the reason that most plants have a green color .

These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins . In such proteins , the pigments are arranged to work together . Such a combination of proteins is also called a light-harvesting complex . Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts , the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called leaves . Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and aridity , such as many Euphorbia and cactus species , have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems . The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf , called the mesophyll , can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf . The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant waxy cuticle that protects the leaf from excessive evaporation of water and decreases the absorption of ultraviolet or blue light to minimize heating . The transparent epidermis layer allows light to pass through to the palisade mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place .

This electron is taken up by a modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin , which passes the electron to a quinone molecule , starting the flow of electrons down an electron transport chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of NADP to NADPH . In addition , this creates a proton gradient ( energy gradient ) across the chloroplast membrane , which is used by ATP synthase in the synthesis of ATP . The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called photolysis , which releases oxygen . The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is : Not all wavelengths of light can support photosynthesis . The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of accessory pigments present . For example , in green plants , the action spectrum resembles the absorption spectrum for chlorophylls and carotenoids with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light . In red algae , the action spectrum is blue-green light , which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths ( red light ) used by above-ground green plants . The non-absorbed part of the light spectrum is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color ( e.g. , green plants , red algae , purple bacteria ) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms .

The light-dependent reactions are of two forms : cyclic and non-cyclic . In the non-cyclic reaction , the photons are captured in the light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosystem II by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments ( see diagram `` Z-scheme '' ) . The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex loosens an electron by a process called photoinduced charge separation . The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center . That loosened electron is taken up by the primary electron-acceptor molecule , pheophytin . As the electrons are shuttled through an electron transport chain ( the so-called Z-scheme shown in the diagram ) , a chemiosmotic potential is generated by pumping proton cations ( H+ ) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space . An ATP synthase enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during photophosphorylation , whereas NADPH is a product of the terminal redox reaction in the Z-scheme . The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in Photosystem I . There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that photosystem .

The electron is eventually used to reduce the coenzyme NADP with an H+ to NADPH ( which has functions in the light-independent reaction ) ; at that point , the path of that electron ends . The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic but differs in that it generates only ATP , and no reduced NADP ( NADPH ) is created . The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I . Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem , the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I , from where it was emitted , hence the name cyclic reaction . Linear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized . Elevating another electron will first require re-reduction of the reaction center . The excited electrons lost from the reaction center ( P700 ) of photosystem I are replaced by transfer from plastocyanin , whose electrons come from electron transport through photosystem II . Photosystem II , as the first step of the Z-scheme , requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a reaction center . The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria is water . Two water molecules are oxidized by the energy of four successive charge-separation reactions of photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic oxygen and four hydrogen ions .

The oxidation of water is catalyzed in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four manganese ions and a calcium ion ; this oxygen-evolving complex binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction ( Kok 's S-state diagrams ) . The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis . Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions , but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen and its energy for cellular respiration , including photosynthetic organisms .

The latter occurs not only in plants but also in animals when the carbon and energy from plants is passed through a food chain . The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which carbon dioxide combines with a five-carbon sugar , ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate , to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound , glycerate 3-phosphate , also known as 3-phosphoglycerate . Glycerate 3-phosphate , in the presence of ATP and NADPH produced during the light-dependent stages , is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate . This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde ( PGAL ) or , more generically , as triose phosphate . Most ( five out of six molecules ) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced are used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue . The triose phosphates not thus `` recycled '' often condense to form hexose phosphates , which ultimately yield sucrose , starch , and cellulose , as well as glucose and fructose . The sugars produced during carbon metabolism yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of amino acids and lipids . In hot and dry conditions , plants close their stomata to prevent water loss . Under these conditions , CO2 will decrease and oxygen gas , produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis , will increase , causing an increase of photorespiration by the oxygenase activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase ( RuBisCO ) and decrease in carbon fixation .

Some plants have evolved mechanisms to increase the CO2 concentration in the leaves under these conditions . Plants that use the C4 carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate ( PEP ) , a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called PEP carboxylase , creating the four-carbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid . Oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme RuBisCO and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located , and where CO2 released by decarboxylation of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids . The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases CO2 fixation and , thus , the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf . C4 plants can produce more sugar than C3 plants in conditions of high light and temperature . Many important crop plants are C4 plants , including maize , sorghum , sugarcane , and millet . Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called C3 plants because the primary carboxylation reaction , catalyzed by RuBisCO , produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle . Over 90 % of plants use C3 carbon fixation , compared to 3 % that use C4 carbon fixation ; however , the evolution of C4 in over sixty plant lineages makes it a striking example of convergent evolution .

C2 photosynthesis , which involves carbon-concentration by selective breakdown of photorespiratory glycine , is both an evolutionary precursor to C4 and a useful carbon-concentrating mechanism in its own right . Xerophytes , such as cacti and most succulents , also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called Crassulacean acid metabolism ( CAM ) . In contrast to C4 metabolism , which spatially separates the CO2 fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle , CAM temporally separates these two processes . CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from C3 plants , and fix the CO2 at night , when their stomata are open . CAM plants store the CO2 mostly in the form of malic acid via carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate , which is then reduced to malate . Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases CO2 inside the leaves , thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO . CAM is used by 16,000 species of plants . Calcium-oxalate-accumulating plants , such as Amaranthus hybridus and Colobanthus quitensis , show a variation of photosynthesis where calcium oxalate crystals function as dynamic carbon pools , supplying carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) to photosynthetic cells when stomata are partially or totally closed . This process was named alarm photosynthesis . Under stress conditions ( e.g. , water deficit ) , oxalate released from calcium oxalate crystals is converted to CO2 by an oxalate oxidase enzyme , and the produced CO2 can support the Calvin cycle reactions .

Reactive hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) , the byproduct of oxalate oxidase reaction , can be neutralized by catalase . Alarm photosynthesis represents a photosynthetic variant to be added to the well-known C4 and CAM pathways . However , alarm photosynthesis , in contrast to these pathways , operates as a biochemical pump that collects carbon from the organ interior ( or from the soil ) and not from the atmosphere . Cyanobacteria possess carboxysomes , which increase the concentration of CO2 around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis . An enzyme , carbonic anhydrase , located within the carboxysome , releases CO2 from dissolved hydrocarbonate ions ( HCO\u22123 ) . Before the CO2 can diffuse out , RuBisCO concentrated within the carboxysome quickly sponges it up . HCO\u22123 ions are made from CO2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein . They can not cross the membrane as they are charged , and within the cytosol they turn back into CO2 very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase . This causes the HCO\u22123 ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes . Pyrenoids in algae and hornworts also act to concentrate CO2 around RuBisCO .

This fact allows measurement of the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers . Actual plants ' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted , light intensity , temperature , and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , and can vary from 0.1 % to 8 % . By comparison , solar panels convert light into electric energy at an efficiency of approximately 6\u201320 % for mass-produced panels , and above 40 % in laboratory devices . Scientists are studying photosynthesis in hopes of developing plants with increased yield . The efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured , but the relationship between the two can be complex . For example , the light reaction creates ATP and NADPH energy molecules , which C3 plants can use for carbon fixation or photorespiration . Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks . For this reason , it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions .

With some instruments , even wavelength dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed .

In the photosynthetic cell of an alga , bacterium , or plant , there are light-sensitive molecules called chromophores arranged in an antenna-shaped structure called a photocomplex .

The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks . Fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old . More recent studies also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago , though the first direct evidence of photosynthesis comes from thylakoid membranes preserved in 1.75-billion-year-old cherts . Oxygenic photosynthesis is the main source of oxygen in the Earth 's atmosphere , and its earliest appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe . Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis , such as that in cyanobacteria , became important during the Paleoproterozoic era around two billion years ago . Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic , using water as an electron donor , which is oxidized to molecular oxygen in the photosynthetic reaction center .

In addition , a few marine mollusks , such as Elysia viridis and Elysia chlorotica , also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies ( see Kleptoplasty ) . This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time . Some of the genes from the plant cell nucleus have even been transferred to the slugs , so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins they need to survive . An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts . Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria , including a circular chromosome , prokaryotic-type ribosome , and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center . The endosymbiotic theory suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired ( by endocytosis ) by early eukaryotic cells to form the first plant cells . Therefore , chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells . Like mitochondria , chloroplasts possess their own DNA , separate from the nuclear DNA of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in cyanobacteria . DNA in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers .

Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as electron donors . Green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids as electron donors . Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules . The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that Earth 's early atmosphere was highly reducing at that time . With a possible exception of Heimdallarchaeota , photosynthesis is not found in archaea . Haloarchaea are photoheterotrophic ; they can absorb energy from the sun , but do not harvest carbon from the atmosphere and are therefore not photosynthetic . Instead of chlorophyll they use rhodopsins , which convert light-energy to ion gradients but can not mediate electron transfer reactions . In bacteria eight photosynthetic lineages are currently known : The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once , in a common ancestor of extant cyanobacteria ( formerly called blue-green algae ) . The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth 's history , at least 2450\u20132320 million years ago ( Ma ) , and , it is speculated , much earlier . Because the Earth 's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis , it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen .

A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial evolution opened about 2000 Ma , revealing an already-diverse biota of cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria remained the principal primary producers of oxygen throughout the Proterozoic Eon ( 2500\u2013543 Ma ) , in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation . Green algae joined cyanobacteria as the major primary producers of oxygen on continental shelves near the end of the Proterozoic , but only with the Mesozoic ( 251\u201366 Ma ) radiations of dinoflagellates , coccolithophorids , and diatoms did the primary production of oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern form . Cyanobacteria remain critical to marine ecosystems as primary producers of oxygen in oceanic gyres , as agents of biological nitrogen fixation , and , in modified form , as the plastids of marine algae . Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood , the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century . Jan van Helmont began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when he carefully measured the mass of the soil a plant was using and the mass of the plant as it grew . After noticing that the soil mass changed very little , he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water , the only substance he added to the potted plant .

However , this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant 's biomass comes from the inputs of photosynthesis , not the soil itself . Joseph Priestley , a chemist and minister , discovered that when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar and burned a candle in it ( which gave off CO2 ) , the candle would burn out very quickly , much before it ran out of wax . He further discovered that a mouse could similarly `` injure '' air . He then showed that a plant could restore the air the candle and the mouse had `` injured '' . In 1779 , Jan Ingenhousz repeated Priestley 's experiments . He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours . In 1796 , Jean Senebier , a Swiss pastor , botanist , and naturalist , demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light . Soon afterward , Nicolas-Th\u00e9odore de Saussure showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO2 but also to the incorporation of water .

By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria , he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction in which hydrogen reduces ( donates its atoms as electrons and protons to ) carbon dioxide . Robert Emerson discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light . With the red alone , the light reactions were suppressed . When blue and red were combined , the output was much more substantial . Thus , there were two photosystems , one absorbing up to 600 nm wavelengths , the other up to 700 nm . The former is known as PSII , the latter is PSI . PSI contains only chlorophyll `` a '' , PSII contains primarily chlorophyll `` a '' with most of the available chlorophyll `` b '' , among other pigments . These include phycobilins , which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae , respectively , and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms . The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta is equal in both PSII and PSI , assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII systems , which in turn powers the photochemistry .

These are linked by plastoquinone , which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939 . He showed that isolated chloroplasts give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like iron oxalate , ferricyanide or benzoquinone after exposure to light . In the Hill reaction : A is the electron acceptor . Therefore , in light , the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved . Samuel Ruben and Martin Kamen used radioactive isotopes to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water . Melvin Calvin and Andrew Benson , along with James Bassham , elucidated the path of carbon assimilation ( the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle ) in plants . The carbon reduction cycle is known as the Calvin cycle , but many scientists refer to it as the Calvin-Benson , Benson-Calvin , or even Calvin-Benson-Bassham ( or CBB ) Cycle .

In 1893 , the American botanist Charles Reid Barnes proposed two terms , photosyntax and photosynthesis , for the biological process of synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid , in the presence of chlorophyll , under the influence of light .

For that original and ground-breaking work , a Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961 . In parallel , plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 \u03bcmol CO2\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7s\u22121 , with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants have the same photosynthetic capacities , that are light saturated at less than 50 % of sunlight .

This higher rate in maize was almost double of those observed in other species such as wheat and soybean , indicating that large differences in photosynthesis exist among higher plants .

This type of anatomy was termed Kranz anatomy in the 19th century by the botanist Gottlieb Haberlandt while studying leaf anatomy of sugarcane . Plant species with the greatest photosynthetic rates and Kranz anatomy showed no apparent photorespiration , very low CO2 compensation point , high optimum temperature , high stomatal resistances and lower mesophyll resistances for gas diffusion and rates never saturated at full sun light . The research at Arizona was designated a Citation Classic in 1986 . These species were later termed C4 plants as the first stable compound of CO2 fixation in light has four carbons as malate and aspartate . Other species that lack Kranz anatomy were termed C3 type such as cotton and sunflower , as the first stable carbon compound is the three-carbon PGA . At 1000 ppm CO2 in measuring air , both the C3 and C4 plants had similar leaf photosynthetic rates around 60 \u03bcmol CO2\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7s\u22121 indicating the suppression of photorespiration in C3 plants . There are four main factors influencing photosynthesis and several corollary factors . The four main are : Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors . These include the amount of light available , the amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light ( shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis ) , the rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the chloroplasts to support photosynthesis , the availability of water , and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis .

The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere , and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life . The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable , in both time and space . In the early 20th century , Frederick Blackman and Gabrielle Matthaei investigated the effects of light intensity ( irradiance ) and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation . These two experiments illustrate several important points : First , it is known that , in general , photochemical reactions are not affected by temperature . However , these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation , so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation . These are the light-dependent 'photochemical ' temperature-independent stage , and the light-independent , temperature-dependent stage . Second , Blackman 's experiments illustrate the concept of limiting factors . Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light . Cyanobacteria , which reside several meters underwater , can not receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments . To combat this problem , Cyanobacteria have a light-harvesting complex called Phycobilisome .

This process , called photorespiration , uses energy , but does not produce sugars .

    "text": "A black hole is an astronomical body so compact that its gravity prevents anything , including light , from escaping . Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will form a black hole . The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon . In general relativity , a black hole 's event horizon seals an object 's fate but produces no locally detectable change when crossed . General relativity also predicts that every black hole should have a central singularity , where the curvature of spacetime is infinite . In many ways , a black hole acts like an ideal black body , as it reflects no light . Quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation , with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass . This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes , making it essentially impossible to observe directly . Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace . In 1916 , Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterise a black hole . Due to his influential research , the Schwarzschild metric is named after him . David Finkelstein , in 1958 , first published the interpretation of `` black hole '' as a region of space from which nothing can escape .

The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1 , identified by several researchers independently in 1971 . Black holes typically form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle . After a black hole has formed , it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings . Supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses may form by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes , or via direct collapse of gas clouds . There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies . The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light . Matter falling toward a black hole can form an accretion disk of infalling plasma , heated by friction and emitting light . In extreme cases , this creates a quasar , some of the brightest objects in the universe . Merging black holes can also be detected by observation of the gravitational waves they emit . If other stars are orbiting a black hole , their orbits can be used to determine the black hole 's mass and location . Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars .

The idea of a body so massive that even light could not escape was briefly proposed by English astronomical pioneer and clergyman John Michell and independently by French scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace . Both scholars proposed very large stars in contrast to the modern concept of an extremely dense object . Michell 's idea , in a short part of a letter published in 1784 , calculated that a star with the same density but 500 times the radius of the sun would not let any emitted light escape ; the surface escape velocity would exceed the speed of light . : 122 Michell correctly noted that such supermassive but non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their gravitational effects on nearby visible bodies . In 1796 , Laplace mentioned that a star could be invisible if it were sufficiently large while speculating on the origin of the Solar System in his book Exposition du Syst\u00e8me du Monde . Franz Xaver von Zach asked Laplace for a mathematical analysis , which Laplace provided and published in a journal edited by von Zach . Laplace omitted his comment about invisible stars in later editions of his book , perhaps because Thomas Young 's wave theory of light had cast doubt on the validity of the corpuscles of light used in Laplace 's mathematical analysis . : 123 In 1905 Albert Einstein showed that the laws of electromagnetism would be invariant under a Lorentz transformation : they would be identical for observers travelling at different velocities relative to each"

This discovery became known as the principle of special relativity . Although the laws of mechanics had already been shown to be invariant , gravity remained yet to be included . : 19 To add gravity to the his theory of relativity , Einstein was guided by observations by Galileo Galilei , Isaac Newton and others which showed inertial mass equalled gravitational mass . : 11 In 1907 , Einstein published a paper proposing his equivalence principle , the hypothesis that this equality means the two forms of mass have a common cause . Using the principle , Einstein predicted the redshift effect of gravity on light . : 19 In 1911 , Einstein predicted the deflection of light by massive bodies , but his analysis was premature and off by a factor of two . : 19 By 1917 , Einstein refined these ideas into his general theory of relativity , which explained how matter affects spacetime , which in turn affects the motion of other matter . This theory formed the basis for black hole physics . Only a few months after Einstein published the field equations describing general relativity , astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild set out to apply the idea to stars .

At a certain radius from the center of the mass , the Schwarzschild solution became singular , meaning that some of the terms in the Einstein equations became infinite . The nature of this radius , which later became known as the Schwarzschild radius , was not understood at the time . Many physicists of the early 20th century were skeptical of the existence of black holes . In a 1926 popular science book , Arthur Eddington discussed the idea of a star with mass compressed to its Schwarzschild radius , but his analysis was meant to illustrate issues in the then-poorly-understood theory of general relativity rather than to seriously analyze the problem : Eddington did not believe black holes existed . : 134 In 1939 , Einstein himself used his theory of general relativity in an attempt to prove that black holes were impossible . His work relied on increasing pressure or increasing centrifugal force balancing the force of gravity so that the object would not collapse beyond its Schwarzschild radius . He missed the possibility that implosion would drive the system below this critical value . : 135 By the 1920s , astronomers had classified a number of white dwarf stars as too cool and dense to be explained by the gradual cooling of ordinary stars .

Eddington and , later , Lev Landau argued that some yet unknown mechanism would stop the collapse . They were partially correct : a white dwarf slightly more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a neutron star , which is itself stable . These arguments from senior scientists delayed acceptance of Chandrasekhar 's model . : 159 In the 1930s , Fritz Zwicky and Walter Baade studied stellar novae , focusing on exceptionally bright ones they called supernovae .

Harrison and Wheeler developed the equations of state relating density to pressure for cold matter all the way from atoms through electron degeneracy to neutron degeneracy . Masami Wakano and Wheeler then used the equations to compute the equilibrium curve for stars , relating mass to circumference . They found no additional features that would invalidate the TOV limit .

Two years later , Ezra Newman found the cylindrically symmetric solution for a black hole that is both rotating and electrically charged . In 1967 , Werner Israel found that the Schwarzschild solution was the only possible solution for a nonspinning , uncharged black hole , and could n't have any additional parameters . In that sense , a Schwarzschild black hole would be defined by its mass alone , and any two Schwarzschild black holes with the same mass would be identical . Israel later found that Reissner-Nordstrom black holes were only defined by their mass and electric charge , while Brandon Carter discovered that Kerr black holes only had two degrees of freedom , mass and spin . Together , these findings became known as the no-hair theorem , which states that a stationary black hole is completely described by the three parameters of the Kerr\u2013Newman metric : mass , angular momentum , and electric charge . At first , it was suspected that the strange mathematical singularities found in each of the black hole solutions only appeared due to the assumption that a black hole would be perfectly spherically symmetric , and therefore the singularities would not appear in generic situations where black holes would not"

This view was held in particular by Vladimir Belinski , Isaak Khalatnikov , and Evgeny Lifshitz , who tried to prove that no singularities appear in generic solutions , although they would later reverse their positions . However , in 1965 , Roger Penrose proved that general relativity without quantum mechanics requires that singularities appear in all black holes . Shortly afterwards , Hawking generalized Penrose 's solution to find that in all but a few physically infeasible scenarios , a cosmological Big Bang singularity is inevitable unless quantum gravity intervenes . Astronomical observations also made great strides during this era . In 1967 , Antony Hewish and Jocelyn Bell Burnell discovered pulsars and by 1969 , these were shown to be rapidly rotating neutron stars . Until that time , neutron stars , like black holes , were regarded as just theoretical curiosities , but the discovery of pulsars showed their physical relevance and spurred a further interest in all types of compact objects that might be formed by gravitational collapse . Based on observations in Greenwich and Toronto in the early 1970s , Cygnus X-1 , a galactic X-ray source discovered in 1964 , became the first astronomical object commonly accepted to be a black hole . Work by James Bardeen , Jacob Bekenstein , Carter , and Hawking in the early 1970s led to the formulation of black hole thermodynamics .

These laws describe the behaviour of a black hole in close analogy to the laws of thermodynamics by relating mass to energy , area to entropy , and surface gravity to temperature . The analogy was completed : 442 when Hawking , in 1974 , showed that quantum field theory implies that black holes should radiate like a black body with a temperature proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole , predicting the effect now known as Hawking radiation . The first strong evidence for black holes came from combined X-ray and optical observations of Cygnus X-1 in 1972 . The x-ray source , located in the Cygnus constellation , was discovered through a survey by two suborbital rockets , as the blocking of x-rays by Earth 's atmosphere makes it difficult to detect them from the ground . Unlike stars or pulsars , Cygnus X-1 was not associated with any prominent radio or optical source . In 1972 , Louise Webster , Paul Murdin , and , independently , Charles Thomas Bolton , found that Cygnus X-1 was actually in a binary system with the supergiant star HDE 226868 . Using the emission patterns of the visible star , both research teams found that the mass of Cygnus X-1 was likely too large to be a white dwarf or neutron star , indicating that it was probably a black hole .

While Cygnus X-1 , a stellar-mass black hole , was generally accepted by the scientific community as a black hole by the end of 1973 , it would be decades before a supermassive black hole would gain the same broad recognition . Although , as early as the 1960s , physicists such as Donald Lynden-Bell and Martin Rees had suggested that powerful quasars in the center of galaxies were powered by accreting supermassive black holes , little observational proof existed at the time . However , the Hubble Space Telescope , launched decades later , found that supermassive black holes were not only present in these active galactic nuclei , but that supermassive black holes in the center of galaxies were ubiquitous : Almost every galaxy had a supermassive black hole at its center , many of which were quiescent . In 1999 , David Merritt proposed the M\u2013sigma relation , which related the dispersion of the velocity of matter in the center bulge of a galaxy to the mass of the supermassive black hole at its core . Subsequent studies confirmed this correlation . Around the same time , based on telescope observations of the velocities of stars at the center of the Milky Way galaxy , independent work groups led by Andrea Ghez and Reinhard Genzel concluded that the compact radio source in the center of the galaxy , Sagittarius A * , was likely a supermassive black hole .

At the time of the merger , the black holes were approximately 1.4 billion light-years away from Earth and had masses of 30 and 35 solar masses . : 6 The mass of the resulting black hole was approximately 62 solar masses , with an additional three solar masses radiated away as gravitational waves . The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ( LIGO ) detected the gravitational waves by using two mirrors spaced four kilometers apart to measure microscopic changes in length . In 2017 , Rainer Weiss , Kip Thorne , and Barry Barish , who had spearheaded the project , were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work . Since the initial discovery in 2015 , hundreds more gravitational waves have been observed by LIGO and another interferometer , Virgo .

Science writer Marcia Bartusiak traces the term `` black hole '' to physicist Robert H. Dicke , who in the early 1960s reportedly compared the phenomenon to the Black Hole of Calcutta , notorious as a prison where people entered but never left alive . The term black hole was used in print by Life and Science News magazines in 1963 , and by science journalist Ann Ewing in her article `` 'Black Holes ' in Space '' , dated 18 January 1964 , which was a report on a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science held in Cleveland , Ohio . A black hole is generally defined as a region of spacetime from which no information-carrying signals or objects can escape . However , verifying an object as a black hole by this definition would require waiting for an infinite time and at an infinite distance from the black hole to verify that indeed , nothing has escaped , and thus can not be used to identify a physical black hole . Broadly , physicists do not have a precisely-agreed-upon definition of a black hole . Among astrophysicists , a black hole is a compact object with a mass larger than four solar masses . A black hole may also be defined as a reservoir of information : 142 or a region where space is falling inwards faster than the speed of light .

If the conjecture is true , any two black holes that share the same values for these properties , or parameters , are indistinguishable from one another . The degree to which the conjecture is true for real black holes is currently an unsolved problem . The simplest static black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor angular momentum . These black holes are often referred to as Schwarzschild black holes after Karl Schwarzschild , who discovered the solution in 1916 . According to Birkhoff 's theorem , it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric . Solutions describing more general black holes also exist . Non-rotating charged black holes are described by the Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric , while the Kerr metric describes a non-charged rotating black hole .

Because these singularities make the universe inherently unpredictable , many physicists believe they could not exist . The weak cosmic censorship hypothesis , proposed by Sir Roger Penrose , rules out the formation of such singularities , when they are created through the gravitational collapse of realistic matter . However , this theory has not yet been proven , and some physicists believe that naked singularities could exist . It is also unknown whether black holes could even become extremal , forming naked singularities , since natural processes counteract increasing spin and charge when a black hole becomes near-extremal .

All black holes spin , often fast\u2014One supermassive black hole , GRS 1915+105 has been estimated to spin at over 1,000 revolutions per second . The Milky Way 's central black hole Sagittarius A * rotates at about 90 % of the maximum rate . The spin rate can be inferred from measurements of atomic spectral lines in the X-ray range . As gas near the black hole plunges inward , high energy X-ray emission from electron-positron pairs illuminates the gas further out , appearing red-shifted due to relativistic effects . Depending on the spin of the black hole , this plunge happens at different radii from the hole , with different degrees of redshift . Astronomers can use the gap between the x-ray emission of the outer disk and the redshifted emission from plunging material to determine the spin of the black hole . A newer way to estimate spin is based on the temperature of gasses accreting onto the black hole . The method requires an independent measurement of the black hole mass and inclination angle of the accretion disk followed by computer modeling .

A charged black hole repels other like charges just like any other charged object . If a black hole were to become charged , particles with an opposite sign of charge would be pulled in by the extra electromagnetic force , while particles with the same sign of charge would be repelled , neutralizing the black hole .

The minimum mass of a black hole formed by stellar gravitational collapse is governed by the maximum mass of a neutron star and is believed to be approximately two-to-four solar masses .

The Penrose process , which involves extraction of a black hole 's rotational energy , has also been proposed as a potential mechanism of jet propulsion . Due to conservation of angular momentum , gas falling into the gravitational well created by a massive object will typically form a disk-like structure around the object . : 242 As the disk 's angular momentum is transferred outward due to internal processes , its matter falls farther inward , converting its gravitational energy into heat and releasing a large flux of x-rays . The temperature of these disks can range from thousands to millions of Kelvin , and temperatures can differ throughout a single accretion disk . Accretion disks can also emit in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum , depending on the disk 's turbulence and magnetization and the black hole 's mass and angular momentum .

Accretion disks of black holes accreting beyond the Eddington limit are often referred to as `` polish donuts '' due to their thick , toroidal shape that resembles that of a donut . Quasar accretion disks are expected to usually appear blue in color .

For a photon orbiting prograde , the photon sphere will be 1-3 Schwarzschild radii from the center of the black hole , while for a photon orbiting retrograde , the photon sphere will be between 3-5 Schwarzschild radii from the center of the black hole . The exact location of the photon sphere depends on the magnitude of the black hole 's rotation . For a charged , nonrotating black hole , there will only be one photon sphere , and the radius of the photon sphere will decrease for increasing black hole charge . For non-extremal , charged , rotating black holes , there will always be two photon spheres , with the exact radii depending on the parameters of the black hole . Near a rotating black hole , spacetime rotates similar to a vortex . The rotating spacetime will drag any matter and light into rotation around the spinning black hole .

Other more speculative mechanisms include primordial black holes created from density fluctuations in the early universe , the collapse of dark stars , a hypothetical object powered by annihilation of dark matter , or from hypothetical self-interacting dark matter . Gravitational collapse occurs when an object 's internal pressure is insufficient to resist the object 's own gravity . At the end of a star 's life , it will run out of hydrogen to fuse , and will start fusing more and more massive elements , until it gets to iron . Since the fusion of elements heavier than iron would require more energy than it would release , nuclear fusion ceases .

Fluctuations of spacetime soon after the Big Bang may have formed areas that were denser then their surroundings .

Restrictions have been proposed to limit the growth rate of black holes . In theory , at a certain rate of accretion , the outward radiation pressure will become as strong as the inward gravitational force , and the black hole will be unable to accrete any faster . This limit is called the Eddington limit . However , in practicality , many black holes accrete beyond this rate due to their non-spherical geometry or instabilities in the accretion disk . Accretion beyond the limit is called Super-Eddington accretion and may have been commonplace in the early universe . Additionally , mergers of supermassive black holes may take a long time : As a binary of supermassive black holes approach each other , most nearby stars are ejected , leaving little for the remaining black holes to gravitationally interact with that would allow them to get closer to each other . This phenomenon has been called the final parsec problem , as the distance at which this happens is usually around one parsec . When a black hole accretes matter , the gas in the inner accretion disk orbits at very high speeds because of its proximity to the black hole . The resulting friction is so significant that it heats the inner disk to temperatures at which it emits vast amounts of electromagnetic radiation ( mainly X-rays ) . These bright X-ray sources may be detected by telescopes .

By the time the matter of the disk reaches the ISCO , it will have given off a significant amount of energy : Between 5.7 % and 42 % of its mass will have been converted to energy , depending on the black hole 's spin . Most of this energy ( about 90 % ) is released in a relatively small area , within about 20 black hole radii . In many cases , accretion disks are accompanied by relativistic jets that are emitted along the black hole 's poles , which carry away much of the energy . The mechanism for the creation of these jets is currently not well understood , in part due to insufficient data . As such , many of the universe 's most energetic phenomena have been attributed to the accretion of matter on black holes . In particular , active galactic nuclei and quasars are believed to be the accretion disks of supermassive black holes . Similarly , X-ray binaries are generally accepted to be binary star systems in which one of the two stars is a compact object accreting matter from its companion . It has also been suggested that some ultraluminous X-ray sources may be the accretion disks of intermediate-mass black holes .

It is also analogous to a special relativistic effect called the Unruh effect , which predicts that an accelerating observer should detect a higher temperature of their surroundings than a nonaccelerating observer .

If Hawking 's theory of black hole radiation is correct , then black holes are expected to shrink and evaporate over time as they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles . The temperature of this thermal spectrum ( Hawking temperature ) is proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole , which is inversely proportional to the mass . Hence , large black holes emit less radiation than small black holes. : Ch . 9.6 A stellar black hole of 1 M\u2609 has a Hawking temperature of 62 nanokelvins .

For a very small black hole , quantum gravity effects are expected to play an important role and could hypothetically make the black hole stable , although current developments in quantum gravity do not indicate this is the case . The Hawking radiation for an astrophysical black hole is predicted to be very weak and would thus be exceedingly difficult to detect from Earth . A possible exception is the burst of gamma rays emitted in the last stage of the evaporation of primordial black holes .

The black hole 's shadow appears as a dark circle in the centre of the image , bordered by the orange-red ring of its accretion disk . The bottom half of the disk is brighter than the top due to Doppler beaming : Material at the bottom of the disk , which is travelling towards the viewer at relativistic speeds , appears brighter than the material at the top of the disk , which is travelling away from the viewer . In April 2023 , the EHT team presented an image of the shadow of the Messier 87 black hole and its high-energy jet , viewed together for the first time .

Because Sagittarius A * is one thousand times less massive as M87 * , its accretion disk has a much shorter orbital period , so the environment around Sagittarius A * was rapidly changing as the EHT team was trying to image it . Additionally , turbulent plasma lies between Sagittarius A * and Earth , preventing resolution of the image at longer wavelengths .

Because the two objects were only 350 km apart just before the merger , yet were more massive than possible for a neutron star , the LIGO team concluded that the gravitational waves must have come from a merger of two black holes . The signal observed by LIGO also included the start of the post-merger ringdown , the signal produced as the newly formed compact object settles down to a stationary state . From the ringdown , the LIGO team was able to determine that the resulting merged black hole was spinning at 67 % of the maximum rate and had a mass of 62 solar masses , having lost three solar masses as gravitational waves during the merger"

From the ringdown , the LIGO team was able to determine that the resulting merged black hole was spinning at 67 % of the maximum rate and had a mass of 62 solar masses , having lost three solar masses as gravitational waves during the merger . The observation also provides the first observational evidence for the existence of stellar-mass black hole binaries . Furthermore , it is the first observational evidence of stellar-mass black holes weighing 25 solar masses or more . Since then , many more gravitational wave events have been observed . The proper motions of stars near the centre of the Milky Way provide strong observational evidence that these stars are orbiting a supermassive black hole . Since 1995 , astronomers have tracked the motions of 90 stars orbiting an invisible object coincident with the radio source Sagittarius A * . In 1998 , by fitting the motions of the stars to Keplerian orbits , the astronomers were able to infer that Sagittarius A * must be a 2.6\u00d7106 M\u2609 object must be contained within a radius of 0.02 light-years . Since then , one of the stars\u2014called S2\u2014has completed a full orbit . From the orbital data , astronomers were able to refine the calculations of the mass of Sagittarius A * to 4.3\u00d7106 M\u2609 , with a radius of less than 0.002 light-years . This upper limit radius is larger than the Schwarzschild radius for the estimated mass , so the combination does not prove Sagittarius A * is a black hole .

Additionally , there is some observational evidence that this object might possess an event horizon , a feature unique to black holes . The Event Horizon Telescope image of Sagittarius A * , released in 2022 , provided further confirmation that it is indeed a black hole . X-ray binaries are binary systems that emit a majority of their radiation in the X-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum . These X-ray emissions result when a compact object accretes matter from an ordinary star . The presence of an ordinary star in such a system provides an opportunity for studying the central object and to determine if it might be a black hole . By measuring the orbital period of the binary , the distance to the binary from Earth , and the mass of the companion star , scientists can estimate the mass of the compact object . The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit ( TOV limit ) dictates the largest mass a nonrotating neutron star can be , and is estimated to be about two solar masses . While a rotating neutron star can be slightly more massive , if the compact object is much more massive than the TOV limit , it can not be a neutron star and is generally expected to be a black hole .

The first strong candidate for a black hole , Cygnus X-1 , was discovered in this way by Charles Thomas Bolton , Louise Webster , and Paul Murdin in 1972 . Observations of rotation broadening of the optical star reported in 1986 lead to a compact object mass estimate of 16 solar masses , with 7 solar masses as the lower bound . In 2011 , this estimate was updated to 14.1\u00b11.0 M\u2609 for the black hole and 19.2\u00b11.9 M\u2609 for the optical stellar companion . X-ray binaries can be categorized as either low-mass or high-mass ; This classification is based on the mass of the companion star , not the compact object itself . In a class of X-ray binaries called soft X-ray transients , the companion star is of relatively low mass , allowing for more accurate estimates of the black hole mass . These systems actively emit X-rays for only several months once every 10\u201350 years . During the period of low X-ray emission , called quiescence , the accretion disk is extremely faint , allowing detailed observation of the companion star . Numerous black hole candidates have been measured by this method . Black holes are also sometimes found in binaries with other compact objects , such as white dwarfs , neutron stars , and other black holes . The centre of nearly every galaxy contains a supermassive black hole .

Astronomers use the term `` active galaxy '' to describe galaxies with unusual characteristics , such as unusual spectral line emission and very strong radio emission . Theoretical and observational studies have shown that the high levels of activity in the centers of these galaxies , regions called active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) , may be explained by accretion onto supermassive black holes . These AGN consist of a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times more massive than the Sun , a disk of interstellar gas and dust called an accretion disk , and two jets perpendicular to the accretion disk . Although supermassive black holes are expected to be found in most AGN , only some galaxies ' nuclei have been more carefully studied in attempts to both identify and measure the actual masses of the central supermassive black hole candidates . Some of the most notable galaxies with supermassive black hole candidates include the Andromeda Galaxy , Messier 32 , Messier 87 , the Sombrero Galaxy , and the Milky Way itself . The X-ray emissions from the disks of accreting black holes sometimes flicker at certain frequencies . These signals are called quasi-periodic oscillations and are thought to be caused by material moving along the inner edge of the accretion disk ( the innermost stable circular orbit ) . Some scientists also suggest that these oscillations may be caused by the black hole 's axis of rotation being out of alignment with the binary system 's axis"

Since the frequency of quasi-periodic oscillations is correlated with the mass and rotation rate of the compact object , it can be used as an alternative way to determine the properties of candidate black holes . Another way black holes can be detected is through observation of effects caused by their strong gravitational field . One such effect is gravitational lensing : The deformation of spacetime around a massive object causes light rays to be deflected , making objects behind them appear distorted . When the lensing object is a black hole , this effect can be strong enough to create multiple images of a star or other luminous source . However , the distance between the lensed images may be too small for contemporary telescopes to resolve\u2014This phenomenon is called microlensing . Instead of seeing two images of a lensed star , astronomers see the star brighten slightly as the black hole moves towards the line of sight between the star and Earth and then return to its normal luminosity as the black hole moves away . The turn of the millennium saw the first 3 candidate detections of black holes in this way , and in January 2022 , astronomers reported the first confirmed detection of a microlensing event from an isolated black hole .

While there is a strong case for supermassive black holes , the model for stellar-mass black holes assumes of an upper limit for the mass of a neutron star : objects observed to have more mass are assumed to be black holes . However , the properties of extremely dense matter are poorly understood . New exotic phases of matter could allow other kinds of massive objects . Quark stars would be made up of quark matter and supported by quark degeneracy pressure , a form of degeneracy pressure even stronger than neutron degeneracy pressure . This would halt gravitational collapse at a higher mass than for a neutron star . Even stronger stars called electroweak stars would convert quarks in their cores into leptons , providing additional pressure to stop the star from collapsing . If , as some extensions of the Standard Model posit , quarks and leptons are made up of the even-smaller fundamental particles called preons , a very compact star could be supported by preon degeneracy pressure .

A black star would be gravitationally collapsing slowly enough that quantum effects would keep it just on the cusp of fully collapsing into a black hole . A gravastar would consist of a very thin shell and a dark-energy interior providing outward pressure to stop the collapse into a black hole or formation of a singularity ; It could even have another gravastar inside , called a 'nestar ' . Since the average density of a black hole inside its Schwarzschild radius is inversely proportional to the square of its mass , supermassive black holes are much less dense than stellar black holes . The average density of a 108 M\u2609 black hole is comparable to that of water . Consequently , the physics of matter forming a supermassive black hole is much better understood and the possible alternative explanations for supermassive black hole observations are much more mundane .

When black holes were thought to persist forever , this information loss was not problematic , as the information can be thought of as existing inside the black hole . However , black holes slowly evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation . This radiation does not appear to carry any additional information about the matter that formed the black hole , meaning that this information is seemingly be gone forever . This is called the black hole information paradox . This paradox pits a foundational principle of quantum mechanics against one of general relativity . According to quantum mechanics , a pure state with no entropy can never evolve into a mixed state with entropy , a consequence of unitarity . All Hawking radiation , as thermal radiation , is in a mixed quantum state . Over vast amounts of time , the entire black hole is converted to this mixed-state radiation . Therefore , any quantum system in a pure state that had fallen into the black hole before it radiated away would seemingly have been converted into mixed-state radiation , violating unitarity .

Quantum mechanics can describe many systems that classical physics can not . Classical physics can describe many aspects of nature at an ordinary ( macroscopic and ( optical ) microscopic ) scale , but is not sufficient for describing them at very small submicroscopic ( atomic and subatomic ) scales . Classical mechanics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation that is valid at ordinary scales . Quantum systems have bound states that are quantized to discrete values of energy , momentum , angular momentum , and other quantities , in contrast to classical systems where these quantities can be measured continuously . Measurements of quantum systems show characteristics of both particles and waves ( wave\u2013particle duality ) , and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement , given a complete set of initial conditions ( the uncertainty principle ) . Quantum mechanics arose gradually from theories to explain observations that could not be reconciled with classical physics , such as Max Planck 's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem , and the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein 's 1905 paper , which explained the photoelectric effect .

The time evolution of a quantum state is described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation : i \u210f \u2202 \u2202 t \u03c8 ( t ) = H \u03c8 ( t ) . { \\displaystyle i\\hbar { \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial t } } \\psi ( t ) =H\\psi ( t ) . } Here H { \\displaystyle H } denotes the Hamiltonian , the observable corresponding to the total energy of the system , and \u210f { \\displaystyle \\hbar } is the reduced Planck constant . The constant i \u210f { \\displaystyle i\\hbar } is introduced so that the Hamiltonian is reduced to the classical Hamiltonian in cases where the quantum system can be approximated by a classical system ; the ability to make such an approximation in certain limits is called the correspondence principle . The solution of this differential equation is given by \u03c8 ( t ) = e \u2212 i H t / \u210f \u03c8 ( 0 ) . { \\displaystyle \\psi ( t ) =e^ { -iHt/\\hbar } \\psi ( 0 ) . } The operator U ( t ) = e \u2212 i H t / \u210f { \\displaystyle U ( t ) =e^ {"

Some wave functions produce probability distributions that are independent of time , such as eigenstates of the Hamiltonian . : 133\u2013137 Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such `` static '' wave functions . For example , a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus , whereas in quantum mechanics , it is described by a static wave function surrounding the nucleus . For example , the electron wave function for an unexcited hydrogen atom is a spherically symmetric function known as an s orbital ( Fig . 1 ) . Analytic solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation are known for very few relatively simple model Hamiltonians including the quantum harmonic oscillator , the particle in a box , the dihydrogen cation , and the hydrogen atom .

Even the helium atom \u2013 which contains just two electrons \u2013 has defied all attempts at a fully analytic treatment , admitting no solution in closed form . However , there are techniques for finding approximate solutions . One method , called perturbation theory , uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to create a result for a related but more complicated model by ( for example ) the addition of a weak potential energy . : 793 Another approximation method applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces only small deviations from classical behavior . These deviations can then be computed based on the classical motion . : 849 One consequence of the basic quantum formalism is the uncertainty principle . In its most familiar form , this states that no preparation of a quantum particle can imply simultaneously precise predictions both for a measurement of its position and for a measurement of its momentum . Both position and momentum are observables , meaning that they are represented by Hermitian operators . The position operator X ^ { \\displaystyle { \\hat { X } } } and momentum operator P ^ { \\displaystyle { \\hat { P } } } do not commute , but rather satisfy the canonical commutation relation : [ X ^ , P ^ ] = i \u210f . { \\displaystyle [ { \\hat { X } } , { \\hat { P } } ] =i\\hbar . } Given a quantum state , the Born rule lets us compute expectation values for both X { \\displaystyle X } and P { \\displaystyle P } , and moreover for powers"

The fact that dependence in momentum is the Fourier transform of the dependence in position means that the momentum operator is equivalent ( up to an i / \u210f { \\displaystyle i/\\hbar } factor ) to taking the derivative according to the position , since in Fourier analysis differentiation corresponds to multiplication in the dual space .

POVMs are extensively used in quantum information theory . As described above , entanglement is a key feature of models of measurement processes in which an apparatus becomes entangled with the system being measured . Systems interacting with the environment in which they reside generally become entangled with that environment , a phenomenon known as quantum decoherence . This can explain why , in practice , quantum effects are difficult to observe in systems larger than microscopic . There are many mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics . One of the oldest and most common is the `` transformation theory '' proposed by Paul Dirac , which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations of quantum mechanics \u2013 matrix mechanics ( invented by Werner Heisenberg ) and wave mechanics ( invented by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger ) . An alternative formulation of quantum mechanics is Feynman 's path integral formulation , in which a quantum-mechanical amplitude is considered as a sum over all possible classical and non-classical paths between the initial and final states . This is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the action principle in classical mechanics . The Hamiltonian H { \\displaystyle H } is known as the generator of time evolution , since it defines a unitary time-evolution operator U ( t ) = e \u2212 i H t / \u210f { \\displaystyle U ( t ) =e^ { -iHt/\\hbar } } for each value of t { \\displaystyle t } . From this relation between U ( t ) { \\displaystyle U ( t ) } and H { \\displaystyle H } , it follows that any observable A {"

From this relation between U ( t ) { \\displaystyle U ( t ) } and H { \\displaystyle H } , it follows that any observable A { \\displaystyle A } that commutes with H { \\displaystyle H } will be conserved : its expectation value will not change over time . : 471 This statement generalizes , as mathematically , any Hermitian operator A { \\displaystyle A } can generate a family of unitary operators parameterized by a variable t { \\displaystyle t } . Under the evolution generated by A { \\displaystyle A } , any observable B { \\displaystyle B } that commutes with A { \\displaystyle A } will be conserved .

This implies a quantum version of the result proven by Emmy Noether in classical ( Lagrangian ) mechanics : for every differentiable symmetry of a Hamiltonian , there exists a corresponding conservation law . The simplest example of a quantum system with a position degree of freedom is a free particle in a single spatial dimension . A free particle is one which is not subject to external influences , so that its Hamiltonian consists only of its kinetic energy : H = 1 2 m P 2 = \u2212 \u210f 2 2 m d 2 d x 2 . { \\displaystyle H= { \\frac { 1 } { 2m } } P^ { 2 } =- { \\frac { \\hbar ^ { 2"

One can also start from an established classical model of a particular system , and then try to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit . This approach is known as quantization . : 299 When quantum mechanics was originally formulated , it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was non-relativistic classical mechanics . For instance , the well-known model of the quantum harmonic oscillator uses an explicitly non-relativistic expression for the kinetic energy of the oscillator , and is thus a quantum version of the classical harmonic oscillator . : 234 Complications arise with chaotic systems , which do not have good quantum numbers , and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems . : 353 Quantum decoherence is a mechanism through which quantum systems lose coherence , and thus become incapable of displaying many typically quantum effects : quantum superpositions become simply probabilistic mixtures , and quantum entanglement becomes simply classical correlations . : 687\u2013730 Quantum coherence is not typically evident at macroscopic scales , though at temperatures approaching absolute zero quantum behavior may manifest macroscopically .

For example , the stability of bulk matter ( consisting of atoms and molecules which would quickly collapse under electric forces alone ) , the rigidity of solids , and the mechanical , thermal , chemical , optical and magnetic properties of matter are all results of the interaction of electric charges under the rules of quantum mechanics . Early attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved the replacement of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a covariant equation such as the Klein\u2013Gordon equation or the Dirac equation . While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results , they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles . A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory , which applies quantization to a field ( rather than a fixed set of particles ) . The first complete quantum field theory , quantum electrodynamics , provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction . Quantum electrodynamics is , along with general relativity , one of the most accurate physical theories ever devised . The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems . A simpler approach , one that has been used since the inception of quantum mechanics , is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic field .

Quantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developed . The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called quantum chromodynamics , and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons . The weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified , in their quantized forms , into a single quantum field theory ( known as electroweak theory ) , by the physicists Abdus Salam , Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg . Even though the predictions of both quantum theory and general relativity have been supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence , their abstract formalisms contradict each other and they have proven extremely difficult to incorporate into one consistent , cohesive model .

However , the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in physical cosmology and the search by physicists for an elegant `` Theory of Everything '' ( TOE ) . Consequently , resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th- and 21st-century physics . This TOE would combine not only the models of subatomic physics but also derive the four fundamental forces of nature from a single force or phenomenon . One proposal for doing so is string theory , which posits that the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings . String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other . On distance scales larger than the string scale , a string looks just like an ordinary particle , with its mass , charge , and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string . In string theory , one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton , a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force . Another popular theory is loop quantum gravity ( LQG ) , which describes quantum properties of gravity and is thus a theory of quantum spacetime .

Since its inception , the many counter-intuitive aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many interpretations . The arguments centre on the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics , the difficulties with wavefunction collapse and the related measurement problem , and quantum nonlocality . Perhaps the only consensus that exists about these issues is that there is no consensus . Richard Feynman once said , `` I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics . '' According to Steven Weinberg , `` There is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics . '' The views of Niels Bohr , Werner Heisenberg and other physicists are often grouped together as the `` Copenhagen interpretation '' . According to these views , the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory , but is instead a final renunciation of the classical idea of `` causality '' . Bohr in particular emphasized that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement , due to the complementary nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations .

Albert Einstein , himself one of the founders of quantum theory , was troubled by its apparent failure to respect some cherished metaphysical principles , such as determinism and locality . Einstein 's long-running exchanges with Bohr about the meaning and status of quantum mechanics are now known as the Bohr\u2013Einstein debates . Einstein believed that underlying quantum mechanics must be a theory that explicitly forbids action at a distance . He argued that quantum mechanics was incomplete , a theory that was valid but not fundamental , analogous to how thermodynamics is valid , but the fundamental theory behind it is statistical mechanics . In 1935 , Einstein and his collaborators Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen published an argument that the principle of locality implies the incompleteness of quantum mechanics , a thought experiment later termed the Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox . [ note 4 ] In 1964 , John Bell showed that EPR 's principle of locality , together with determinism , was actually incompatible with quantum mechanics : they implied constraints on the correlations produced by distance systems , now known as Bell inequalities , that can be violated by entangled particles . Since then several experiments have been performed to obtain these correlations , with the result that they do in fact violate Bell inequalities , and thus falsify the conjunction of locality with determinism .

Bohmian mechanics shows that it is possible to reformulate quantum mechanics to make it deterministic , at the price of making it explicitly nonlocal . It attributes not only a wave function to a physical system , but in addition a real position , that evolves deterministically under a nonlocal guiding equation . The evolution of a physical system is given at all times by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation together with the guiding equation ; there is never a collapse of the wave function . This solves the measurement problem . Everett 's many-worlds interpretation , formulated in 1956 , holds that all the possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes . This is a consequence of removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet . All possible states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus , together with the observer , are present in a real physical quantum superposition . While the multiverse is deterministic , we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities , because we do not observe the multiverse as a whole , but only one parallel universe at a time . Exactly how this is supposed to work has been the subject of much debate .

Quantum mechanics was developed in the early decades of the 20th century , driven by the need to explain phenomena that , in some cases , had been observed in earlier times . Scientific inquiry into the wave nature of light began in the 17th and 18th centuries , when scientists such as Robert Hooke , Christiaan Huygens and Leonhard Euler proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental observations . In 1803 English polymath Thomas Young described the famous double-slit experiment . This experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light . During the early 19th century , chemical research by John Dalton and Amedeo Avogadro lent weight to the atomic theory of matter , an idea that James Clerk Maxwell , Ludwig Boltzmann and others built upon to establish the kinetic theory of gases . The successes of kinetic theory gave further credence to the idea that matter is composed of atoms , yet the theory also had shortcomings that would only be resolved by the development of quantum mechanics .

One important discovery in that regard was Michael Faraday 's 1838 observation of a glow caused by an electrical discharge inside a glass tube containing gas at low pressure . Julius Pl\u00fccker , Johann Wilhelm Hittorf and Eugen Goldstein carried on and improved upon Faraday 's work , leading to the identification of cathode rays , which J. J. Thomson found to consist of subatomic particles that would be called electrons . The black-body radiation problem was discovered by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1859 . In 1900 , Max Planck proposed the hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete `` quanta '' ( or energy packets ) , yielding a calculation that precisely matched the observed patterns of black-body radiation . The word quantum derives from the Latin , meaning `` how great '' or `` how much '' . According to Planck , quantities of energy could be thought of as divided into `` elements '' whose size ( E ) would be proportional to their frequency ( \u03bd ) : E = h \u03bd { \\displaystyle E=h\\nu \\ } , where h is the Planck constant . Planck cautiously insisted that this was only an aspect of the processes of absorption and emission of radiation and was not the physical reality of the radiation . In fact , he considered his quantum hypothesis a mathematical trick to get the right answer rather than a sizable discovery .

Niels Bohr then developed Planck 's ideas about radiation into a model of the hydrogen atom that successfully predicted the spectral lines of hydrogen . Einstein further developed this idea to show that an electromagnetic wave such as light could also be described as a particle ( later called the photon ) , with a discrete amount of energy that depends on its frequency . In his paper `` On the Quantum Theory of Radiation '' , Einstein expanded on the interaction between energy and matter to explain the absorption and emission of energy by atoms . Although overshadowed at the time by his general theory of relativity , this paper articulated the mechanism underlying the stimulated emission of radiation , which became the basis of the laser . This phase is known as the old quantum theory . Never complete or self-consistent , the old quantum theory was rather a set of heuristic corrections to classical mechanics . The theory is now understood as a semi-classical approximation to modern quantum mechanics . Notable results from this period include , in addition to the work of Planck , Einstein and Bohr mentioned above , Einstein and Peter Debye 's work on the specific heat of solids , Bohr and Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen 's proof that classical physics can not account for diamagnetism , and Arnold Sommerfeld 's extension of the Bohr model to include special-relativistic effects .

In 1923 , the French physicist Louis de Broglie put forward his theory of matter waves by stating that particles can exhibit wave characteristics and vice versa . Building on de Broglie 's approach , modern quantum mechanics was born in 1925 , when the German physicists Werner Heisenberg , Max Born , and Pascual Jordan developed matrix mechanics and the Austrian physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger invented wave mechanics . Born introduced the probabilistic interpretation of Schr\u00f6dinger 's wave function in July 1926 . Thus , the entire field of quantum physics emerged , leading to its wider acceptance at the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927 . By 1930 , quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by David Hilbert , Paul Dirac and John von Neumann with greater emphasis on measurement , the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality , and philosophical speculation about the 'observer ' . It has since permeated many disciplines , including quantum chemistry , quantum electronics , quantum optics , and quantum information science .

Dates for the beginning of the Pacific War include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937 , or the earlier Japanese invasion of Manchuria , on 18 September 1931 . Other proposed starting dates for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935 . The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939 . Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start or prelude to World War II . The exact date of the war 's end is also not universally agreed upon . It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 15 August 1945 ( V-J Day ) , rather than with the formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945 , which officially ended the war in Asia . A peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951 . A 1990 treaty regarding Germany 's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place .

World War I had radically altered the political European map with the defeat of the Central Powers\u2014including Austria-Hungary , Germany , Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire\u2014and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia , which led to the founding of the Soviet Union .

Under the treaty , Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all its overseas possessions , while German annexation of other states was prohibited , reparations were imposed , and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country 's armed forces . The German Empire was dissolved in the German revolution of 1918\u20131919 , and a democratic government , later known as the Weimar Republic , was created . The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the political right and left . Italy , as an Entente ally , had made some post-war territorial gains ; however , Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement . From 1922 to 1925 , the fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist , totalitarian , and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy , repressed socialist , left-wing , and liberal forces , and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power , promising the creation of a `` New Roman Empire '' .

France , seeking to secure its alliance with Italy , allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia , which Italy desired as a colonial possession . The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany , and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles , accelerated his rearmament programme , and introduced conscription . The United Kingdom , France and Italy formed the Stresa Front in April 1935 in order to contain Germany , a key step towards military globalisation ; however , that June , the United Kingdom made an independent naval agreement with Germany , easing prior restrictions . The Soviet Union , concerned by Germany 's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe , drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France . Before taking effect , though , the Franco-Soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations , which rendered it essentially toothless .

The Kuomintang party in China launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s , but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) allies and new regional warlords . In 1931 , an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan , which had long sought influence in China as the first step of what its government saw as the country 's right to rule Asia , staged the Mukden incident as a pretext to invade Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo . China appealed to the League of Nations to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria . Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for its incursion into Manchuria .

The war resulted in the military occupation of Ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of Italian East Africa ( Africa Orientale Italiana ) ; in addition it exposed the weakness of the League of Nations as a force to preserve peace . Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations , but the League did little when the former clearly violated Article X of the League 's Covenant . The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion , but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion . Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany 's goal of absorbing Austria . When civil war broke out in Spain , Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the Nationalist rebels , led by General Francisco Franco . Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis : Mussolini sent more than 70,000 ground troops , 6,000 aviation personnel , and 720 aircraft to Spain .

In July 1937 , Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of Peking after instigating the Marco Polo Bridge incident , which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China following years of tension and low-level conflicts . The Soviets quickly signed a non-aggression pact with China to lend materiel support , effectively ending China 's prior cooperation with Germany . From September to November , the Japanese attacked Taiyuan , engaged the Kuomintang Army around Xinkou , fought Communist forces in Pingxingguan , and wrestled control over China 's northern railway network . Nationalist Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai , but after three months of heavy fighting , Shanghai fell . The Japanese continued to push Chinese forces back , capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937 .

In the mid-to-late 1930s , Japanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and Mongolia . The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron , which emphasised Japan 's expansion northward , was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time . This policy would prove difficult to maintain in light of the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939 , the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets . Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941 , and Japan adopted the doctrine of Nanshin-ron , promoted by the Navy , which took its focus southward and eventually led to war with the United States and the Western Allies .

Although all of Germany 's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement , privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation . In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish `` war-mongers '' and in January 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy . In March 1939 , Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a pro-German client state , the Slovak Republic .

The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war , as it had in World War I . Immediately afterwards , Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August , but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality , he decided to delay it .

Some 3.3 million Soviet POWs would die in German captivity by the war 's end in total , a nearly 60 % mortality rate . By mid-August , however , the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre , and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad . The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful , resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies , and made possible further advance into Crimea and industrially-developed eastern Ukraine ( the First Battle of Kharkov ) . The diversion of three-quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front prompted the United Kingdom to reconsider its grand strategy . In July , the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany and in August , the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter , which outlined British and American goals for the post-war world .

By October , Axis powers had achieved operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region , with only the sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing . A major offensive against Moscow was renewed ; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather , the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow , where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend the offensive . Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces , but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives : two key cities remained in Soviet hands , the Soviet capability to resist was not broken , and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential . The blitzkrieg phase of the war in Europe had ended . By early December , freshly mobilised reserves allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops . This , as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army , allowed the Soviets to begin a massive counter-offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops 100\u2013250 kilometres ( 62\u2013155 mi ) west .

Despite several offensives by both sides , by 1940 the war between China and Japan was at a stalemate . To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes , and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers , Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina in September 1940 . Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940 . In August , Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China ; in retaliation , Japanese armies in North China implemented the Three Alls Policy , a massive scorched earth initiative to depopulate regions deemed hostile to Japanese occupation .. Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941 , effectively ending their co-operation .

Hirohito refused the recommendation to appoint Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni in his place , choosing War Minister Hideki Tojo instead . On 3 November , Nagano explained in detail the plan of the attack on Pearl Harbor to the Emperor . On 5 November , Hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for the war . On 20 November , the new government presented an interim proposal as its final offer . It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan . In exchange , Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina . The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers .

The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war . To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter , it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset . On 7 December 1941 ( 8 December in Asian time zones ) , Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific . These included an attack on the American fleets at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines , as well as invasions of Guam , Wake Island , Malaya , Thailand , and Hong Kong . These attacks led the United States , United Kingdom , China , Australia , and several other states to formally declare war on Japan , whereas the Soviet Union , being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries , maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan .

During 1942 , Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue . All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective . The Americans favoured a straightforward , large-scale attack on Germany through France . The Soviets demanded a second front . The British argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength , leading to increasing demoralisation , and bolstering resistance forces ; Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign . An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour , without using large-scale armies . Eventually , the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa . At the Casablanca Conference in early 1943 , the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies . The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes .

Japanese advances were accompanied by numerous atrocities , including the Sook Ching Massacre in Singapore . Despite stubborn resistance by Filipino and US forces , the Philippine Commonwealth was eventually captured in May 1942 , forcing its government into exile .

In mid-May , Japan started the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign in China , with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying Chinese air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups . In early June , Japan put its operations into action , but the Americans had broken Japanese naval codes in late May and were fully aware of the plans and order of battle , and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy . With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle , Japan attempted to capture Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua .

Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal , with Japanese forces suffering massive losses in the attrition , especially amongst their elite pilots . By the start of 1943 , the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops . In Burma , Commonwealth forces mounted two operations . The first was a disastrous offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942 that forced a retreat back to India by May 1943 . The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese frontlines in February which , by the end of April , had achieved mixed results .

The Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive , starting with an encirclement of the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad , and an assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow , though the latter failed . By early February 1943 , the German army had taken tremendous losses ; German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated , and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive . In mid-February , after the Soviet push had tapered off , the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov , creating a salient in their front line around the Soviet city of Kursk .

Concerns that the Japanese might use bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942 . An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein . On the Continent , raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets , culminating in the failed Dieppe Raid , demonstrated the Western Allies ' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation , equipment , and operational security . In August 1942 , the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El Alamein and , at a high cost , managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta . A few months later , the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt , dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya . This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa , which resulted in the region joining the Allies . Hitler responded to the French colony 's defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France ; although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice , they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces .

The firebombing of Hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign , inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre . After the Guadalcanal campaign , the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific . In May 1943 , Canadian and US forces were sent to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians . Soon after , the United States , with support from Australia , New Zealand and Pacific Islander forces , began major ground , sea and air operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands , and breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands . By the end of March 1944 , the Allies had completed both of these objectives and had also neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands .

This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies ' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July , which , combined with previous Italian failures , resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month . On 12 July 1943 , the Soviets launched their own counter-offensives , thereby nearly completely dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east . The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority , giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front . The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther\u2013Wotan line , but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and the Lower Dnieper Offensive .

In November 1943 , Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran . The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma campaign , while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany 's defeat . From November 1943 , during the seven-week Battle of Changde , the Chinese awaited Allied relief as they forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition .

In northern Serbia , the Soviet Red Army , with limited support from Bulgarian forces , assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October . A few days later , the Soviets launched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945 .

In February , the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania , while the Western Allies entered western Germany and closed to the Rhine river . By March , the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr , encircling the German Army Group B . In early March , in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in Hungary and retake Budapest , Germany launched its last major offensive against Soviet troops near Lake Balaton . Within two weeks , the offensive had been repulsed , the Soviets advanced to Vienna , and captured the city . In early April , Soviet troops captured K\u00f6nigsberg , while the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg . American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April , leaving unoccupied pockets in southern Germany and around Berlin . Soviet troops stormed and captured Berlin in late April .

Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April . On 30 April , Hitler committed suicide in his headquarters , and was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz ( as President of the Reich ) and Joseph Goebbels ( as Chancellor of the Reich ) . Goebbels also committed suicide on the following day and was replaced by Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk , in what would later be known as the Flensburg Government . Total and unconditional surrender in Europe was signed on 7 and 8 May , to be effective by the end of 8 May . German Army Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May . On 23 May all remaining members of the German government were arrested by Allied forces in Flensburg . On 5 June all German political and military institutions were placed under Allied control through the Berlin Declaration . In the Pacific theatre , American forces accompanied by the forces of the Philippine Commonwealth advanced in the Philippines , clearing Leyte by the end of April 1945 .

A devastating bombing raid on Tokyo of 9\u201310 March was the deadliest conventional bombing raid in history . In May 1945 , Australian troops landed in Borneo , overrunning the oilfields there . British , American , and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern Burma in March , and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by 3 May . Chinese forces started a counterattack in the Battle of West Hunan that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945 . American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan , taking Iwo Jima by March , and Okinawa by the end of June . At the same time , a naval blockade by submarines was strangling Japan 's economy and drastically reducing its ability to supply overseas forces . On 11 July , Allied leaders met in Potsdam , Germany . They confirmed earlier agreements about Germany , and the American , British and Chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of Japan , specifically stating that `` the alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction '' .

Between the two bombings , the Soviets , pursuant to the Yalta agreement , declared war on Japan , invaded Japanese-held Manchuria and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army , which was the largest Japanese fighting force . These two events persuaded previously adamant Imperial Army leaders to accept surrender terms . The Red Army also captured the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands . On the night of 9\u201310 August 1945 , Emperor Hirohito announced his decision to accept the terms demanded by the Allies in the Potsdam Declaration . On 15 August , the Emperor communicated this decision to the Japanese people through a speech broadcast on the radio ( Gyokuon-h\u014ds\u014d , literally `` broadcast in the Emperor 's voice '' ) .

The global economy suffered heavily from the war , although participating nations were affected differently . The United States emerged much richer than any other nation , leading to a baby boom , and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much greater than that of any of the other powers , and it dominated the world economy . The Allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany from 1945 to 1948 . Due to international trade interdependencies , this policy led to an economic stagnation in Europe and delayed European recovery from the war for several years . At the Bretton Woods Conference in July 1944 , the Allied nations drew up an economic framework for the post-war world . The agreement created the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) , which later became part of the World Bank Group . The Bretton Woods system lasted until 1973 . Recovery began with the mid-1948 currency reform in West Germany , and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the US Marshall Plan economic aid ( 1948\u20131951 ) both directly and indirectly caused .

Nazi Germany , under the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler , was responsible for killing about 6 million Jews in what is now known as the Holocaust . They also killed an additional 4 million others who were deemed `` unworthy of life '' ( including the disabled and mentally ill , Soviet prisoners of war , Romani , homosexuals , Freemasons , and Jehovah 's Witnesses ) as part of a program of deliberate extermination , in effect becoming a `` genocidal state '' .

By the end of the war , most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to NKVD evaluation , and 226,127 were sent to the Gulag as real or perceived Nazi collaborators . Japanese prisoner-of-war camps , many of which were used as labour camps , also had high death rates . The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 percent ( for American POWs , 37 percent ) , seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians . While 37,583 prisoners from the UK , 28,500 from the Netherlands , and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan , the number of Chinese released was only 56 .

In Western , Northern , and Central Europe ( France , Norway , Denmark , the Low Countries , and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia ) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichsmarks ( 27.8 billion US dollars ) by the end of the war ; this figure does not include the plunder of industrial products , military equipment , raw materials and other goods . Thus , the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation , a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on . In the East , the intended gains of Lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the German invaders . Unlike in the West , the Nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the `` inferior people '' of Slavic descent ; most German advances were thus followed by mass atrocities and war crimes .

Although Japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from European domination , Japanese war crimes frequently turned local public opinion against them . During Japan 's initial conquest , it captured 4,000,000 barrels ( 640,000 m3 ) of oil ( ~550,000 tonnes ) left behind by retreating Allied forces ; and by 1943 , was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels ( 7,900,000 m3 ) of oil ( ~6.8 million tonnes ) , 76 percent of its 1940 output rate . In the 1930s , Britain and the United States together controlled almost 75 % of world mineral output\u2014essential for projecting military power . In Europe , before the outbreak of the war , the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics .

Although the Allies ' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan , they became the decisive factor by 1942 , after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies and the war evolved into one of attrition . While the Allies ' ability to out-produce the Axis was partly due to more access to natural resources , other factors , such as Germany and Japan 's reluctance to employ women in the labour force , Allied strategic bombing , and Germany 's late shift to a war economy contributed significantly . Additionally , neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war , and had not equipped themselves to do so . To improve their production , Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers ; Germany enslaved about 12 million people , mostly from Eastern Europe , while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia .

Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced , including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery , in particular the introduction of the proximity fuze . The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide . Advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare , most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines . Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war , actions at Taranto , Pearl Harbor , and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship ( in place of the battleship ) . In the Atlantic , escort carriers became a vital part of Allied convoys , increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap . Carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft and because they are not required to be as heavily armoured . Submarines , which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War , were expected by all combatants to be important in the second . The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics , such as sonar and convoys , while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability , with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics .

Gradually , improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh Light , Hedgehog , Squid , and homing torpedoes proved effective against German submarines . Land warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of World War I , which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry , to increased mobility and combined arms . The tank , which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War , had evolved into the primary weapon . In the late 1930s , tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I , and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed , armour and firepower . At the start of the war , most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications . This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour , and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat . This , along with Germany 's use of combined arms , were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France . Many means of destroying tanks , including indirect artillery , anti-tank guns ( both towed and self-propelled ) , mines , short-ranged infantry antitank weapons , and other tanks were used . Even with large-scale mechanisation , infantry remained the backbone of all forces , and throughout the war , most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I .

The portable machine gun spread , a notable example being the German MG 34 , and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings . The assault rifle , a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun , became the standard post-war infantry weapon for most armed forces . Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines , the most well-known being the German Enigma machine . Development of SIGINT ( signals intelligence ) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption . Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra , a pioneering method for decoding Enigma that benefited from information given to the United Kingdom by the Polish Cipher Bureau , which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war .
